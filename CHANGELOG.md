# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- upgrade sqlx dependency from 0.8 to 0.9
- adapt tracing instrumentation for sqlx 0.9's consuming `Execute` API and `SqlStr` type (queries are decomposed and reconstructed via `prepare_query` before execution)

### Added

- add `offline` feature to enable `Executor::describe` tracing for compile-time `query!` / offline mode (sqlx 0.9 gates `describe` behind its own offline support; enable with `sqlx-tracing/offline` alongside your database feature, e.g. `features = ["postgres", "offline"]`)

### Fixed

- gate `describe` implementations behind `offline` so the crate builds without enabling sqlx's offline machinery by default (fixes `cargo publish` verify failures)
